# missing data

## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "surveys_complete.csv"))
```

```
## 
## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## cols(
##   record_id = col_double(),
##   month = col_double(),
##   day = col_double(),
##   year = col_double(),
##   plot_id = col_double(),
##   species_id = col_character(),
##   sex = col_character(),
##   hindfoot_length = col_double(),
##   weight = col_double(),
##   genus = col_character(),
##   species = col_character(),
##   taxa = col_character(),
##   plot_type = col_character()
## )
```
</div>

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?  

```r
names(deserts)
```

```
##  [1] "record_id"       "month"           "day"             "year"           
##  [5] "plot_id"         "species_id"      "sex"             "hindfoot_length"
##  [9] "weight"          "genus"           "species"         "taxa"           
## [13] "plot_type"
```

```r
glimpse(deserts)

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?

```r
deserts%>%
  count(genus,sort = T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 x 2
##    genus                n
##    <chr>            <int>
##  1 Dipodomys        16167
##  2 Chaetodipus       6029
##  3 Onychomys         3267
##  4 Reithrodontomys   2694
##  5 Peromyscus        2234
##  6 Perognathus       1629
##  7 Neotoma           1252
##  8 Ammospermophilus   437
##  9 Amphispiza         303
## 10 Spermophilus       249
## # ... with 16 more rows
```

```r
deserts%>%
  count(species, sort=T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 x 2
##    species          n
##    <chr>        <int>
##  1 merriami     10596
##  2 penicillatus  3123
##  3 ordii         3027
##  4 baileyi       2891
##  5 megalotis     2609
##  6 spectabilis   2504
##  7 torridus      2249
##  8 flavus        1597
##  9 eremicus      1299
## 10 albigula      1252
## # ... with 30 more rows
```
34786 total observations
genera: 26
species: 40
Merriami most freqeuently sampled
Clarki, Scutalatus, Tereticaudus, Tigris, Uniparens, and Virdis are least frequently sampled

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.

```r
deserts%>%
  count(taxa, sort=T)
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   taxa        n
##   <chr>   <int>
## 1 Rodent  34247
## 2 Bird      450
## 3 Rabbit     75
## 4 Reptile    14
```

```r
deserts%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=taxa))+
  geom_bar()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`

```r
deserts%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=taxa,fill=plot_type))+
  geom_bar()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->


5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.

```r
deserts%>%
  filter(weight!="NA")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(species,weight), y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

6. Add another layer to your answer from #4 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.

```r
deserts%>%
  filter(weight!="NA")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=species))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point(size=0.5)
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?

```r
deserts%>%
  filter(genus=="Dipodomys",species=="merriami")%>%
  count(year,sort = F)
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 x 2
##     year     n
##  * <dbl> <int>
##  1  1977   264
##  2  1978   389
##  3  1979   209
##  4  1980   493
##  5  1981   559
##  6  1982   609
##  7  1983   528
##  8  1984   396
##  9  1985   667
## 10  1986   406
## # ... with 16 more rows
```

```r
deserts%>%
  filter(genus=="Dipodymus",species=="merriami")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_bar()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->
</div>

8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.

```r
deserts%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight,y=hindfoot_length))+
  geom_jitter(na.rm = T,size=0.5,alpha=0.5)+
  geom_smooth()
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->


9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.

```r
deserts %>% 
  filter(weight!="NA") %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(avg_weight=mean(weight),.groups="keep") %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_weight))
```

```
## # A tibble: 22 x 2
## # Groups:   species [22]
##    species      avg_weight
##    <chr>             <dbl>
##  1 albigula          159. 
##  2 spectabilis       120. 
##  3 spilosoma          93.5
##  4 hispidus           65.6
##  5 fulviventer        58.9
##  6 ochrognathus       55.4
##  7 ordii              48.9
##  8 merriami           43.2
##  9 baileyi            31.7
## 10 leucogaster        31.6
## # ... with 12 more rows
```
Albigula and Spectabilis

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.

```r
deserts%>%  
filter(species!="NA",sex!="NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species,fill=sex))+
  geom_bar(position = position_fill())+ 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title="% of Sex within Species Observations",
       x="Percentage",
       y="Species")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.5),hjust=.5))
```
